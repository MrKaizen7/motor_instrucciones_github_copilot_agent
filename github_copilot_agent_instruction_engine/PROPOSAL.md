# n8nation: Invitation to Build the Future of Collaborative Automation

### **How We Vote:**
- **Weight by contribution:** More points = greater voting weight

### **Practical Example:**
*"How many points is testing worth?"*
- A) 100 (basic) | B) 150 (+documentation) | C) 200 (+improvements) | D) Variable
- **Result:** The community votes B with 67% → Implemented
